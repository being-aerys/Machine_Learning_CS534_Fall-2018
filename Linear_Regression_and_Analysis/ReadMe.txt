-Python3 is used.

-Data_processing.py contains data preprocessing code.

-Gradient_Part1 corresponds to part 1 of the implementation. It an be run using the command:
   
   python Gradiant.py learning_rate epsilon
   Example: python Gradiant.py [.00001,.000001,0.0000001] 0.5
   where: learning_rate is a list of floats and epsilon is a float.
And so on.
