We used Python3 in this implementation.

The folder is composeed of 4 python files and a report with the ReadMe file:

First use chmod 777 Gradiant.py before running each file.


-Data_processing.py contains all method related to part 0.

-Gradiant_p1 correspond to part 1 of the implementation. Can be run using the command:
   
   python Gradiant.py learning_rate epsilon
   Example: python Gradiant.py [.00001,.000001,0.0000001] 0.5
   where: learning_rate is a list of float and epsilon is a float
   
 -Gradiant_p2 correspond to part 2 of the implementation. Can be run using the command
 
 
 
 
 
 -Gradiant_p3
